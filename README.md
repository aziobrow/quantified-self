Quantified Self is a calorie-tracking application, composed of a decoupled front-end and back-end. The front-end is built in JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS, and is hosted on Github Pages.  The application stores foods, which can be associated with meals to track calorie counts for each food, meal, and total.

The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/dionew1/express-qs), and more details can be found in that project's ReadMe.

This was a 2.5 week partner project, and the original repository and project specifications can be found [here](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self).

To set up this project:

1) Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/aziobrow/quantified-self.git`

2) Change into the quantified-self directory

`cd quantified-self`

3) Install the dependencies

`npm install`

4) Spin Up the Server

`npm start`

Optionally, you can also include
`npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev`, which will allow you to run the command `webpack-dev-server` that automatically reloads your files as they change, so that you don't have to manually rebuild every time you want to see your changes.

Once the server is running, check your localhost port to see where to visit in order to interact with the user interface in the browser.
